# EPiC-2023: A Pipeline for Emotion Recognition using Physiological Signals


Team: Guangyi Zhang and Ali Etemad 



















# Statement of Limitations

Please note that this project was developed under specific constraints which may have affected the performance and generalization of the model. Our team was limited to only two members, with me spending less than 30 hours to form this version of code. Additionally, I had very limited GPU resources during the development process.

Despite these constraints, I have built a complete pipeline that can be utilized by other researchers to build upon and potentially improve the model's performance. We encourage the community to explore and experiment with this pipeline to optimize the results further.

In this project, we focused on single channel ECG out of a total of 8 available signales including other modalities. However, we believe that incorporating additional modalities could lead to better results. Our code is designed to be easily extendable, and we welcome researchers to modify and adapt it to their specific needs.

We appreciate any contributions, suggestions, or improvements that others might offer to enhance the performance and applicability of our work. Please feel free to fork this repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to discuss potential improvements.
